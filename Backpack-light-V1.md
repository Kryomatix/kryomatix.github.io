# Backpack Light V1.0
This project is a very early prototype of my concept for a backpack-mounted light. I had a deadline of 2 weeks to complete the project, so I ended up choosing
choosing components that were guaranteed to work, including the Attiny85 and 5050 RGBW neopixels. What I ended up with is a light that attaches magnetically and is
powered externally with USB-C. I carry a USB power bank in my backpack anyways, so powering the light externally isn't a big deal.

The 3D printed housing was modeled with Fusion 360, and the circuit board and schematic were created with KiCad.

I soldered the pins of the USB-C connector individually using the T15-JS02 bent tip on my Hakko soldering station. The rest of the components were soldered with
a medium sized chisel tip.

Due to a difference in labeling between the schematic symbol and datasheet, I accidentally connected the mode button to the reset pin. 
This prevented any code from executing, as the chip was in a constant state of resetting. Fortunately, my hot air station came to the rescue an I removed the Attiny85
so I could cut the trace underneath and run a jumper wire to an unused pin.

The chip covers up the jumper wire, so everything looks normal except for the slightly angled chip.

No glue needed -- everything is held together with some well-measured 3D printed tabs

This version is just a very early prototype. I'm currently working on a version which uses proper, bright red LEDs that
will be bright enough for daytime use.
