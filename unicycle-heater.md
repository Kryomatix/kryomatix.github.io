# KingSong S18 battery heater
A battery powered heater for cold weather operation

The KingSong S18 is powered by LG M50T batteries, which have an ideal operating temperature of 25℃.
Since the unicycle charges the batteries when braking, it is important that they are up to proper temperature.

## Heating elements
I originlly intended to use nichrome 80 wire powered by a 3s lipo battery as the heating element, but quickly realized that it was too thick
and would interfere with the body panels. Eventually I setteled on 0.2x4mm flat nichrome as a thinner alternative. 

Since nichrome wire isn't able to be soldered, I used bare copper wire to bind the main copper wire an the nichrome together.

I then folded the nichrome over to prevent the copper wire from slipping out, and continued wrapping the copper wire.

Finally, I added solder to secure th copper in place.

To install the nichrome strips on the unicyle, I first cleaned the battery packs with isopropyl alchohol, and then added double sided thermal tape.
I then laid the bent nichrome strip down on the adhesive tape.

To insulate the other side of the wire, I covered everything in a layer of kapton tape.

## Electronics

The electronics on this heating system are used for monitoring, and do not have direct control over the heating process. 

Using Arduino on a Seeeduino Xiao, this electronics module features a temperature probe, an oled screen, and a buzzer to let the
user know when the batteries are done heating.

The information is displayed neatly on the side of the unicycle

When plugged into a 3s lipo, the heating system uses around 60 watts, allowing it to heat up 10℃ in less than 5 minutes
